<p><strong>Refugees resettled in the US.</strong> <a href="https://www.refugeeresettlementdata.com/">Axel Dreher et al.</a> have published <a href="https://www.refugeeresettlementdata.com/data.html">person-level data on 2.5+ million refugees</a> who arrived in the US between 1975 and 2008. The anonymized records, obtained from the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/">National Archives</a> and originally collected by the <a href="https://acf.hhs.gov/orr">Office of Refugee Resettlement</a>, indicate each refugee’s country and date of birth, marital and family status, education level and English proficiency, date of US arrival, US city of resettlement, and more. The researchers also combined these records with public reports from the <a href="https://www.wrapsnet.org/">Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2015-11-25-edition/">DIP 2015.11.25</a>) to create a geocoded dataset of annual resettlements by citizenship and destination city from 1975 to 2018.

<p><strong>Arizona migrant deaths.</strong> The <a href="https://humaneborders.info/">Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for Deceased Migrants</a> is a collaboration between <a href="https://webcms.pima.gov/government/medical_examiner/">Pima County’s Office of the Medical Examiner</a> and <a href="https://humaneborders.org/">Humane Borders</a>, a nonprofit that <a href="https://humaneborders.org/water-stations/">maintains water stations in the Sonoran Desert</a>. “Although each organization has a distinct mission, both are committed to the common vision of raising awareness about migrant deaths and lessening the suffering of families by helping to provide closure through the identification of the deceased and the return of remains.” The initiative’s <a href="https://humaneborders.info/app/map.asp">maps and dataset</a> provide details on 3,700+ deaths since 1990, including the deceased’s name, sex, age, and cause of death; their body’s location and condition; and the date reported.

It lists each candidate’s name, gender, birth year, occupation, party, and incumbency status, plus the election’s date, riding, and outcome. And a <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MI5XQ6">new dataset</a> from <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-journal-of-political-science-revue-canadienne-de-science-politique/article/abs/new-dataset-on-the-demographics-of-canadian-federal-election-candidates/62FE243F387DA88718C825961AB24C10">Anna Johnson et al.</a> delves into the demographics of 4,516 Canadian federal candidates from 2008 to 2019, including their gender, age, race, Indigenous background, occupational category, and more.

<p><strong>NBER working papers.</strong> Since 1973, the <a href="https://www.nber.org/">National Bureau of Economic Research</a>’s <a href="https://www.nber.org/about-nber">1,500+ affiliated researchers</a> have published 29,000+ (pre-peer review) articles through the organization’s <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers">working papers series</a>. It <a href="https://www2.nber.org/RePEc/nbr/nberwo/">provides structured information about each paper</a>, using <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/t/papertemplate.html">a template</a> from the <a href="http://repec.org/">RePEc project</a>. PhD student <a href="https://bldavies.com/">Ben Davies</a> has <a href="https://bldavies.com/blog/introducing-nberwp/">converted those files</a> into <a href="https://github.com/bldavies/nberwp">CSV tables and an R package</a> listing each paper’s title, publication month, ID, and authors.

<p><strong>Lightning intensity.</strong> The <a href="https://wwlln.net/">World Wide Lightning Location Network</a> uses radio sensors to detect the location and power of 200+ million lightning strokes per year. Access to WWLLN’s raw, detailed data costs money but earth scientists <a href="http://web.hku.hk/~jkaplan/">Jed O.

<p><strong>Water politics.</strong> Oregon State University’s <a href="https://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/content/international-water-event-database">International Water Events Database</a> summarizes 7,000+ episodes from 1948 to 2008 that “concern water as a scarce or consumable resource or as a quantity to be managed,” categorizing their intensities and indicating the basins and countries involved. The <a href="https://pacinst.org/">Pacific Institute</a>’s <a href="https://www.worldwater.org/water-conflict/">Water Conflict Chronology</a> documents 926 events (including a few legends) between 3000 BC and 2019 that involved violence or the threat of it. Bernhauer et al.’s <a href="https://www.prio.org/Publications/Publication/?x=5118">Water-Related Intrastate Conflict and Cooperation</a> dataset details 10,000+ events in the Middle East, Mediterranean, and Sahel between 1997 and 2009. <strong>Related</strong>: Takeshi Wada’s “<a href="https://ifi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sdgs_wp_2020_wada_en.pdf">Geographic Distribution of Water Conflicts Worldwide: A Comparative Analysis of Four Databases</a>” (<em>pdf</em>) discusses these resources plus <a href="https://www.gdeltproject.org/data.html">GDELT</a>, a broader-scope event database.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Government regulations.</strong> <a href="https://www.quantgov.org/about">QuantGov</a>, an <a href="https://github.com/quantgov">open-source</a> project of the free-market-oriented <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/">Mercatus Center</a>, “solves the problem of quantifying large amounts of policy text for research and comprehension by using machine learning and natural language processing.” Its <a href="https://www.quantgov.org/history">RegData</a> initiative applies this approach to government regulations over time — quantifying their length and linguistic complexity and trying to identify their relevant <a href="https://www.census.gov/naics/">NAICS</a>-classified industries. Its <a href="https://www.quantgov.org/download-data">datasets</a> examine rules enacted by the federal government and most US states, as well as federal and subnational regulations from Australia, Canada, and India.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Medicaid drug utilization, ranked-choice voting, police activity in 2002 Gujarat news coverage, Android permissions, and the cat’s meow.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Three decades of Medicaid prescriptions.</strong> US law <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19/1927.htm">requires</a> state Medicaid agencies to report the quarterly number of outpatient prescriptions, total units, and reimbursement costs for each permutation of <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/medicaid-drug-rebate-program/index.html">each drug they’ve covered</a>. The federal Medicaid program’s <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/state-drug-utilization-data/index.html">State Drug Utilization Data</a> makes those records — <a href="https://data.medicaid.gov/State-Drug-Utilization/State-Drug-Utilization-Data-2020/va5y-jhsv">which spanned nearly 5 million rows in 2020 alone</a> — available as state-level and national files going back to 1991. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/national-drug-code-directory">The National Drug Code Directory</a>, which “contains product listing data submitted for all finished drugs including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, approved and unapproved drugs and repackaged and relabeled drugs.” [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/maguiremq/status/1395775742621847558">Michael Q.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ranked-choice voting, continued.</strong> <a href="https://www.fairvote.org/about">FairVote</a>, an organization that advocates for <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Ranked-choice_voting_(RCV)">ranked-choice voting</a>, has gathered the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lU6viuXfay323Gl6zkH5itwmrUIUo9rAzalK_ntu-ZY/edit#gid=287253823">results of hundreds of elections</a> that <a href="https://www.fairvote.org/data_on_rcv#research_snapshot">used those rules</a>. The spreadsheets capture both single-winner and multi-winner elections in 26 jurisdictions between 2001 and 2021 — not yet including last week’s New York City primaries, whose results won’t be finalized <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/6/21/22544497/when-will-nyc-mayoral-primary-election-winner-be-announced">until all absentee ballots are processed</a>. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://ranked.vote/">ranked.vote</a>, which provides detailed diagrams and <a href="https://github.com/ranked-vote/reports">data</a> on a smaller number of elections (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-05-27-edition/">DIP 2020.05.27</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Police activity in 2002 Gujarat news coverage.</strong> More than 1,000 people died in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Gujarat_riots">inter-communal violence that erupted in Gujarat, India, in early 2002</a>. A team of political and computational scientists recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12936">trained students to annotate</a> 21,000+ sentences from 1,257 contemporaneous articles about the events published in the Times of India, asking them to categorize whether police officers used force, killed someone, made arrests, failed to intervene, and/or took any other action. The <a href="https://github.com/slanglab/IndiaPoliceEvents">resulting dataset</a> includes the raw annotations as well as final sentence- and document-level classifications.

<p><strong>Android permissions.</strong> Developer <a href="https://gauthamp10.github.io/">Gautham Prakash</a> has built a dataset of the <a href="https://github.com/gauthamp10/android-permissions-dataset">device permissions requested by more than 1 million Android apps</a> in the Google Play marketplace. The permissions include the ability to make calls, read the phone’s contacts, record audio, get the phone’s precise location, know what other apps are running, and dozens more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The cat’s meow.</strong> For a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/9/8/543/htm">2019 study</a>, University of Milan researchers collected and analyzed <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4008297">440 recordings</a> of “meows emitted by cats in different contexts”: when brushed by their owners, when isolated in an unfamiliar environment, and when waiting for food.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>2020 election emails.</strong> To build the <a href="https://electionemails2020.org/">Princeton Corpus of Political Emails</a>, researchers auto-subscribed to thousands of mailing lists run by candidates, political parties, and other groups participating in the 2020 US election cycle. They’ve received 400,000+ messages so far. Since October, you’ve been able to search the corpus online; as of last month, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcgjZo-D1nNON4d90H2j0VLtTdxiHK6Y8HPJSpdRu4w5YILw/viewform">request access</a> to v1.0 of its bulk dataset, which contains 300,000+ emails received through Election Day. For each, it provides the subject and body text, sender, office sought, and more. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://www.lindseycormack.com/dcinbox-data-downloads">Congressional e-newsletters</a> via <a href="https://www.dcinbox.com/">DCinbox</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-03-03-edition/">DIP 2021.03.03</a>), and political emails gathered <a href="https://github.com/the-markup/investigation-wheres-my-email">by The Markup</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/candidate-emails">by FiveThirtyEight</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-03-04-edition/">DIP 2020.03.04</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Civilian harm in Yemen.</strong> The UN-affiliated <a href="https://civilianimpactmonitoring.org/">Civilian Impact Monitoring Project</a> <a href="https://civilianimpactmonitoring.org/methodology">conducts</a> “real-time collection, analysis and dissemination of open source data on the civilian impact from armed violence in Yemen.” Its public datasets include the <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/yemen-civilian-impact-incidents-and-civilian-casualties">monthly incident and casualty counts</a> and the <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/yemen-impact-on-civilian-infrastructure">incidents per region damaging various types of civilian infrastructure</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.acaps.org/">ACAPS</a>, a humanitarian analysis group, <a href="https://data.humdata.org/search?q=%22Yemen%20CrisisInSight%22&amp;sort=title_case_insensitive%20desc">is aggregating data</a> on a range of “key drivers” and outcomes of the crisis (such as fuel prices, malnutrition, and internal displacement) in each district and governorate. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://yemendataproject.org/">The Yemen Data Project</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-04-03-edition/">DIP 2019.04.03</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Medical abbreviations.</strong> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00929-4">Lisa Grossman Liu et al.</a> have developed the <a href="https://github.com/lisavirginia/clinical-abbreviations/tree/master/metainventory">Medical Abbreviation and Acronym Meta-Inventory</a>, a database that maps 104,000+ medical abbreviations and acronyms to 170,000+ different meanings. To build it, the authors standardized data from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00929-4/tables/2">eight sources</a>, including the <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html">Unified Medical Language System</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_medical_abbreviations">Wikipedia</a>, and <a href="http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/arrowsmith_uic/adam.html">ADAM: Another Database of Abbreviations in MEDLINE</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046418302132">At our urban academic medical center, acronyms constituted 30–50% of the words in a typical medicine admission note.</a>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NYC constituent inquiries.</strong> Many members of the New York City Council use <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/districts/data1/">CouncilStat</a> to track their constituents’ requests, complaints, and other inquiries. The tool’s <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Council-Constituent-Services/9hzi-kbqb">public dataset</a> contains 260,000+ anonymized entries going back to 2015. It identifies each inquiry’s topic (e.g., tax preparation, citizenship, affordable housing, street resurfacing), district, and dates opened and closed. <strong>As seen in</strong>: <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/6/15/22536020/nyc-city-council-constituent-service">A pre-election analysis of the requests</a> by <em>The City</em>’s <a href="https://www.twitter.com/annjychoi">Ann Choi</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Forrest Gump-ology.</strong> <a href="https://www.studyforrest.org/">StudyForrest</a> is “a one-of-a-kind resource for studying high-level cognition in the human brain under complex, natural stimulation.” Specifically: while watching <em>Forrest Gump</em>. In addition to fMRI scans and eye-tracking measurements, <a href="https://www.studyforrest.org/data.html">the project’s datasets</a> include extensive annotations of the film itself, such as the <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/5-2273/v1">location and timing of each shot</a>.</p>

It shows drought – but how do we know which colors go where?” <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/">US Drought Monitor</a>, a collaboration between the University of Nebraska and two federal agencies, <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/About/WhatistheUSDM.aspx">describes the process behind its weekly maps</a>. Its <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/About/ContactUs.aspx">authors</a>, who take turns drawing the drought-intensity boundaries, synthesize various sources of quantitative information — such as the <a href="https://wrcc.dri.edu/wwdt/">Palmer Drought Severity Index</a> and the <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/id/snow/?cid=stelprdb1240689">Surface Water Supply Index</a> — and local knowledge. The results can be <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Data.aspx">downloaded</a> as geospatial files, timeseries, and summary statistics. <strong>As seen in</strong>: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/11/climate/california-western-drought-map.html">How Severe Is the Western Drought?

<p> </p>
<p><strong>US vaccinations over time.</strong> The CDC has begun publishing <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh">daily-historical data on vaccination progress in the US</a>, going back to mid-December 2020. For the country overall, each state and territory, and a handful of other jurisdictions (e.g., the Bureau of Prisons), the dataset indicates the number of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and J&amp;J/Janssen doses delivered, total doses administered by age group, percentages of populations fully vaccinated, and more. Less-detailed information is also available for <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh">each county over time</a> and for <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccination-Demographics-in-the-United-St/km4m-vcsb">national demographic trends</a>. <strong>Related</strong>: My colleague <a href="https://www.peteraldhous.com/">Peter Aldhous</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/paldhous/status/1401948291093340160">incorporated</a> the CDC’s data into <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/covid-vaccine-tracker">BuzzFeed News’ vaccination tracker</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Weekly gas prices.</strong> Every Monday, the Energy Information Administration <a href="https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gas_proc-methods.php">collects data</a> “on retail prices for regular, midgrade, and premium grades of gasoline from a sample of retail gasoline outlets across the United States using Form EIA-878, <em>Motor Gasoline Price Survey Schedule A</em>.” The survey informs the agency’s <a href="https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/">average gas price estimates</a>, which are available at a national and regional level, as well as for a few selected states and cities, going back to the 1990s (though the sampling methodology changed in 2018). The EIA also <a href="https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/diesel_proc-methods.php">collects data</a> on diesel prices, using a separate survey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 and fiscal accountability.</strong> The <a href="https://www.internationalbudget.org/">International Budget Partnership</a> has published <a href="https://internationalbudget.org/covid/">an assessment</a> of accountability in the emergency fiscal policies that 120 governments introduced between March and September 2020. The report’s downloadable data (see bottom of page) includes each policy package’s name, date introduced, and whether it was a legislative act or executive decree; ratings on various aspects of transparency, oversight, and participation; and scores on 26 specific questions. <strong>Related</strong>: The partnership’s <a href="https://www.internationalbudget.org/open-budget-survey/about">Open Budget Survey</a> and <a href="https://survey.internationalbudget.org">data explorer</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lynching victims.</strong> In the 1880s–1910s, the Chicago Tribune, Tuskegee University, and the NAACP each began collecting data on lynchings in the US. In the 1990s, sociologists <a href="https://soc.washington.edu/people/stewart-tolnay">Stewart Tolnay</a> and <a href="https://sociology.uga.edu/directory/people/e-m-beck">E.M. Beck</a> reverified, standardized, and extended those three collections, compiling a now-seminal dataset that described 2,800+ victims of these mob-led extrajudicial killings — the majority of whom were Black — in 10 Southern states from 1882–1930. The researchers shared a copy of that data with <a href="http://people.uncw.edu/hinese/HAL/HAL%20Web%20Page.htm">Project HAL</a>, where you can download it. Meanwhile, they and collaborators have continued <a href="http://lynching.csde.washington.edu/#/about">updating and expanding the research</a>; you can <a href="http://lynching.csde.washington.edu/#/contact">request access to their latest datasets</a>. In 2019, sociologists <a href="http://www.charlieseguin.com/">Charles Seguin</a> and <a href="https://rigby.netlify.app/">David Rigby</a> published <a href="https://osf.io/kr8yc/">a dataset</a> that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023119841780">aims to complement Tolnay and Beck’s</a> by presenting information (<a href="http://davidrigbysociology.com/lynching_dot_map">and an interactive map</a>) on 1,328 lynching victims in 38 additional states from 1883–1941.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Gun-dealer violations.</strong> “The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives inspects thousands of licensed gun dealers and manufacturers each year, but what happens in those investigations is rarely revealed to the public.” So reporters at The Trace and USA Today <a href="https://projects.thetrace.org/inspections/methodology/">compiled</a> a <a href="https://projects.thetrace.org/inspections/">database</a> of nearly 2,000 ATF inspections between July 2015 and June 2017 with violations, based on PDFs obtained <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6170066/brady-center-to-prevent-gun-violence-v-us-department-of-justice/">through a FOIA lawsuit</a> by the <a href="https://www.bradyunited.org/">Brady gun control group</a>.

<p><strong>More police misconduct complaints.</strong> The <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> has updated its <a href="https://github.com/new-york-civil-liberties-union/NYPD-Misconduct-Complaint-Database-Updated">NYPD misconduct complaint database</a> to include “the race or ethnicity of the impacted person and officer, incident location, current employment status of the officer, and other data,” and to remove duplicates in the original records obtained from the city. <strong>Also</strong>: Philadelphia publishes <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/police-complaints">monthly-updated data</a> on police complaints from the past five years. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nypd-ccrb/">ProPublica’s subset of the NYPD data</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2020-07-29-edition/">DIP 2020.07.29</a>); and <a href="https://cpdp.co/">CPDP’s database of complaints against Chicago officers</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2015-11-25-edition/">DIP 2015.11.25</a>). <strong>Read more</strong>: The Financial Times has <a href="https://github.com/Financial-Times/police-misconduct-complaints-analysis">compared and analyzed</a> these cities’ datasets, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/141182fc-7727-4af8-a555-5418fa46d09e">finding</a> that the 10% most-cited officers account for roughly a third of all complaints.

<p><strong>Lobbying in Britain.</strong> <a href="https://openaccess.transparency.org.uk/">Open Access UK</a> is a database of 70,000+ meetings between lobbyists and government ministers going back to 2012. The records have been <a href="https://openaccess.transparency.org.uk/about.php">compiled by Transparency International UK</a> from scattered official publications; they list the date of the meeting, the lobbying organization, the minister lobbied, and a brief description of the meeting’s purpose.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rainfall records, rescued.</strong> For centuries, a network of volunteers recorded monthly measurements from thousands of rain gauges across the UK and Ireland. Those observations were trapped on paper forms known “10-year sheets” until very recently, when the UK’s Meteorological Office <a href="https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_d383374a-91c3-4a7b-ba96-41b81cfb9d67">scanned them</a>. But the records still weren’t in an analyzable form, so <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/edh/rainfall-rescue/about/team">a team of climate scientists</a> organized <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/edh/rainfall-rescue">the Rainfall Rescue project</a>, sending <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52040822">a call for help</a> just as Britain entered its first COVID-19 lockdown. Within months, more than 16,000 volunteers had transcribed all 65,000+ pages of scans, entering <a href="https://github.com/ed-hawkins/rainfall-rescue">millions of rain measurements from 1677–1960</a>. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins/status/1392758650201120771">A Twitter thread from organizer Ed Hawkins</a>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Hate groups, law schools, TSA screenings, European cross-border rail, and e.e. cummings.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hate groups.</strong> For decades, the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> has conducted annual censuses of US-based hate groups, <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/20200318/frequently-asked-questions-about-hate-groups">which it defines</a> as those with “beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics.” <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2021/02/01/year-hate-and-extremism-2020-hate-groups-became-more-difficult-track-amid-covid-and">Its 2020 review</a> found 838 such groups — a decline from prior years, which the researchers attribute to several factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the rise of difficult-to-track online networks, and “the continuing collapse of the Ku Klux Klan.” The center’s <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map">map of 2000–2020 findings</a> links to annual spreadsheets that detail each group’s title, location, and ideology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Law schools.</strong> <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/accreditation/">To receive accreditation</a> from the American Bar Association, law schools must submit a range of data-points about tuition, financial aid, student demographics, class sizes, employment outcomes, and more. The ABA’s <a href="http://www.abarequireddisclosures.org/Disclosure509.aspx">disclosure site</a> provides school-level PDF reports, as well as annual spreadsheets comparing all accredited schools since 2011. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/there-are-only-two-black-male-prosecutors-all-long-island">There Are Only Two Black Male Prosecutors For All Of Long Island</a>,” a recent Gothamist article that uses the data. [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/_charleslane">Charles Lane</a>]</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Historical land use, union election results, peace mission mandates, Federal Reserve Bank directors, and television castaways.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Historical land use.</strong> The <a href="https://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/index.html">History Database of the Global Environment</a>, a project of the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, provides <a href="https://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/landusedata/landcover/index-2.html">land use estimates that span 12,000 years</a> — from 10,000 BCE to the near-present. The <a href="https://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/download/index-2.html">datasets</a> <a href="https://easy.dans.knaw.nl/ui/datasets/id/easy-dataset:74467">include</a> gridded, country-level, and regional estimates of cropland, pasture, grazing areas, and other typologies over time. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://clio-infra.eu/">Clio Infra</a> gathers “worldwide data on social, economic, and institutional indicators for the past five centuries,” including estimates of cropland, livestock, metal production, and more.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Union election results.</strong> The US National Labor Relations Board publishes a <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/reports/graphs-data/recent-election-results">searchable and downloadable database</a> that details the results of thousands of union elections <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/conduct-elections">the agency has conducted</a>, going back more than a decade. The records list the employer name and location, tally date and type, petitioned-for employee unit, proposed labor union(s), number of votes for and against those union(s), and more.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Peace mission mandates.</strong> A team led by political scientist <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraHellmuller">Sara Hellmüller</a> has <a href="https://www.peacemissions.info/">categorized the “evolving mandate tasks”</a> of all 121 United Nations peace missions between 1991 and 2020. The dataset identifies 41 kinds of tasks, which it <a href="https://www.peacemissions.info/dataset#definition">sorts into three categories</a>: “minimalist,” “moderate,” and “maximalist.” Minimalist tasks “reflect an approach that contents itself with absence of armed conflict,” while the maximalist approach “seeks to address root causes,” such as by supporting military reform and women’s rights. <strong>Previously</strong>: <a href="https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/open-data-portal">Official UN peacekeeping data</a> and <a href="https://www.pcr.uu.se/data/geo-pko/">the Geocoded Peacekeeping Operations dataset</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2019-11-27-edition/">DIP 2019.11.27</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Federal Reserve Bank directors.</strong> To examine diversity in the US <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed.htm">Federal Reserve System</a>, a team led by central bank–watchers <a href="https://lgst.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/petercb/">Peter Conti-Brown</a> and <a href="https://kalebnygaard.com/">Kaleb Nygaard</a> has <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/diversity-within-the-federal-reserve-system/">compiled a biographical dataset</a> of the nearly 2,000 people who have served as directors of the system’s <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/federal-reserve-system.htm">twelve Reserve Banks</a> between 1914 and 2019. The dataset expands the information available in official reports to include “race, gender, profession, education, age, time spent in position, and whether or not the directors later held a position on the FOMC.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Television castaways.</strong> Statistician <a href="https://twitter.com/danoehm">Dan Oehm</a> has <a href="https://gradientdescending.com/survivor-data-from-the-tv-series-in-r/">constructed a dataset</a> describing all 40 US seasons of <em>Survivor</em>, providing details on every contestant, challenge winner, individual vote, episode viewership, and more. You can access the data as an R package or an Excel file. [h/t <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/mu1ww9/survivor_r_package_a_collection_of_datasets/">u/antirabbit</a>]</p>
