<p> </p>
<p><strong>Post offices.</strong> Historian <a href="https://www.cameronblevins.org/">Cameron Blevins</a> has released a dataset of 166,000+ post offices operating in the US between 1639 and 2000. It includes their years of service and precise/approximate geocoordinates, “making it one of the most fine-grained and expansive datasets currently available for studying the historical geography of the United States.” The project <a href="https://cblevins.github.io/us-post-offices/data-biography/">builds on research by the late Richard W. Helbock</a> and provides the data-foundation for Blevins’s new book, <a href="https://www.cameronblevins.org/paper-trails/"><em>Paper Trails: The US Post and the Making of the American West</em></a>, and <a href="https://gossamernetwork.com/">companion website</a>. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/historying/status/1377336343676608513">Blevins’s introductory Twitter thread</a>.

    <content type="CDATA"><![CDATA[<p><em>US coronavirus case details, high-resolution population densities, electoral gender quotas, EU merger decisions, and dried beans.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>US coronavirus case details.</strong> Last week, the US CDC began publishing a <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4">new, geographically-specific COVID-19 “case surveillance” dataset</a>. Each of the 22 million rows represents a (<a href="https://github.com/CDCgov/covid_case_privacy_review">de-identified</a>) coronavirus case, accounting for roughly 70% of the country’s current official case count. The details include (where available) the person’s county and state of residence; age, sex, race, and ethnicity; “presence of any underlying medical conditions and risk behaviors”; and whether the person was hospitalized and/or died. <strong>Read more</strong>: <a href="https://coviddatadispatch.com/2021/03/28/new-more-local-data-from-the-cdc/">Betsy Ladyzhets writes at the COVID-19 Data Dispatch</a>, “After months of no state-by-state demographic data from the federal government, we now have county-by-county demographic data. This is a pretty big deal!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>High-resolution population densities.</strong> “Using a mixture of machine learning techniques, high-resolution satellite imagery, and population data,” <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/mapping-the-world-to-help-aid-workers-with-weakly-semi-supervised-learning">researchers at Facebook and Columbia University</a> have “mapped hundreds of millions of structures distributed across vast areas and then used that to extrapolate the local population density.” The <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/population-density-maps/">project</a>, which <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2016/02/21/core-data/connecting-the-world-with-better-maps/">began half a decade ago</a>, now provides <a href="https://data.humdata.org/search?organization=facebook&amp;q=%22high%20resolution%20population%20density%22">population density datasets</a> covering much of the world.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Electoral gender quotas.</strong> Many countries apply <a href="https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas/quotas">gender quotas</a> to their parliamentary elections, typically by reserving a certain number of seats for women or by regulating political parties’ candidate lists. In other instances, parties have instituted voluntary quotas. The <a href="https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas">Gender Quotas Database</a> categorizes these rules <a href="https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas/database">for more than 120 nations</a>, and provides additional details through its country profile pages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EU merger decisions.</strong> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3366915">Pauline Affeldt et al.</a> have compiled a <a href="https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.670982.en/pages/research_data_center_for_business_and_organizational_data__rdc-bo.html">quarter century of merger control decisions</a> by the European Commission’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/dgs/competition/index_en.htm">Directorate-General for Competition</a> — decisions relating to 5,000+ cases and 31,000+ product/market combinations between 1990 and 2014.

    <content type="CDATA"><![CDATA[<p><em>Disasters, nursing-home staffing, Brazil’s vaccination registry, probable news quotations, and British millionaires of the late 1920s.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Disasters.</strong> The <a href="https://www.emdat.be/">Emergency Events Database</a> (EM-DAT) contains “essential core data on the occurrence and effects of more than 21,000 [natural and technological] disasters in the world, from 1900 to present.” It <a href="https://www.emdat.be/explanatory-notes">focuses on</a> disasters that have caused 10+ human deaths, affected 100+ people, sparked a state of emergency, and/or prompted a request for international assistance. Where known, the <a href="https://public.emdat.be/">public dataset</a> (registration required) indicates each disaster’s location, type, start/end dates, and estimated damages; the number of people killed, injured, made homeless, or otherwise affected; and more. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/pend-gdis-1960-2018">The Geocoded Disasters (GDIS) Dataset</a> (registration required) <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00846-6">provides spatial coordinates</a> for the natural disasters in EM-DAT from 1960 to 2018.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Nursing-home staffing.</strong> The US Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services requires nursing homes to submit <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/NursingHomeQualityInits/Staffing-Data-Submission-PBJ">detailed payroll information</a>, which the agency converts into <a href="https://data.cms.gov/browse?q=daily+nurse+staffing">public-use files</a> that <a href="https://data.cms.gov/Special-Programs-Initiatives-Long-Term-Care-Facili/PBJ-Public-Use-Files-Data-Documentation/ygny-gzks">summarize</a> daily staffing levels at each facility. The files count employee and contract hours for dozens of types of staff, ranging from administrators to respiratory therapists. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/business/nursing-homes-ratings-medicare-covid.html">Maggots, Rape and Yet Five Stars: How U.S. Ratings of Nursing Homes Mislead the Public</a>,” a recent New York Times investigation that uses the data in several ways.</p>

<p><strong>Police misconduct settlements.</strong> Reporters at FiveThirtyEight and The Marshall Project filed freedom-of-information requests to 50 US cities, asking for data on all civil lawsuits against their police departments/officers “that resulted in a monetary legal settlement” in 2010–2019 — including incident and settlement dates, plaintiff and defendant names, allegation descriptions, amounts awarded, and more. They received <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/police-settlements">full or partial data from 31 of those cities</a>, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends/">found that</a> total payouts <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/02/22/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-that-s-where-the-accountability-ends">exceeded $3 billion</a>. <strong>Don’t miss</strong>: The data repository’s “<a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/police-settlements#words-of-caution">words of caution</a>,” which discourage comparisons between cities. <strong>Related</strong>: Coauthor Laura Bronner’s <a href="https://twitter.com/laurabronner/status/1363961281905106956">introductory Twitter thread</a>.

It’s “the largest open-access dataset on judicial proceedings in the world,” <a href="https://devdatalab.medium.com/big-data-for-justice-f53e0e14c9c9">says project coauthor Aditi Bhowmick</a>. The public dataset contains each case’s state, district, court, case type, filing and decision dates, defendant and petitioner genders, legal codes, and more. It “has been fully anonymized to prevent the identification of individual judges or litigants,” but researchers can apply for more extensive access.

<p><strong>Tens of millions of flights.</strong> The <a href="https://opensky-network.org">OpenSky Network</a> crowdsources air traffic data, thanks to members who collect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast">radio signals that aircraft periodically broadcast</a>. The nonprofit organization has published a “<a href="https://opensky-network.org/community/blog/item/6-opensky-covid-19-flight-dataset">COVID-19 flight dataset</a>,” which contains <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4419082">metadata for the tens of millions of flights</a> those members observed in 2019 and 2020, with plans to update the dataset until the pandemic ends. It includes each flight’s call sign, aircraft model type, origin and destination airports, time first and last seen, and more.

<p><strong>Dot-gov characteristics.</strong> The US General Services Administration publishes a <a href="https://github.com/GSA/data/tree/master/dotgov-domains">list of all registered <em>.gov</em> domains</a> (<a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2017-01-18-edition">DIP 2017.01.18</a>). In <a href="https://ben.balter.com/2011/09/07/analysis-of-federal-executive-domains/">2011</a>, <a href="https://ben.balter.com/2014/07/07/analysis-of-federal-executive-domains-part-deux/">2014</a>, and <a href="https://ben.balter.com/2015/05/11/third-analysis-of-federal-executive-dotgovs/">2015</a>, open-source advocate <a href="https://ben.balter.com/about/">Ben Balter</a> used software to scan each federally-managed domain “to sniff out information about [their] technology and capabilities.” For instance: Do the domains support HTTPS? Do they use Google Analytics? Earlier this month, <a href="https://ben.balter.com/2021/01/11/analysis-of-federal-dotgov-domains-pre-biden-edition/">Balter ran the scan again</a>, “to serve as a snapshot of the state of government technology ahead of the incoming Biden administration.” You can <a href="https://ben.balter.com/2021-analysis-of-federal-dotgov-domains/">browse and download the results</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Corporate risk-talk.</strong> The <a href="https://www.firmlevelrisk.com/">Firm-Level Risk</a> project uses “textual analysis of quarterly earnings conference calls held by more than 11,000 listed firms in 81 countries” to construct company-by-company “measures of exposure, risk, and sentiment.” The <a href="https://www.firmlevelrisk.com/download">dataset</a> goes back nearly two decades and includes sub-measures for various themes, such as tax policy, Brexit, and COVID-19.

<p><strong>Euro-polling.</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/filipvanlaenen/eopaod">European Opinion Polls as Open Data</a> repository collects the results of party-preference polls in 34 countries. For each poll, it lists the polling firm and commissioners, when the fieldwork began and ended, its scope and sample size, and the topline numbers for each party. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://medium.com/grensesnittet/how-simple-things-quickly-become-complicated-in-software-development-9cf52233226d">Project maintainer Filip Van Laenen on “how simple things can turn out to be rather complicated.”</a> [h/t <a href="https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData/commit/c0f0764f9c5b8b429ba71d9ce773967e8c849325">Erik Gahner Larsen</a>]</p>

<p><strong>The da Vinci codex.</strong> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Atlanticus">Codex Atlanticus</a> “is the largest existing collection of original drawings and text by Leonardo da Vinci” — 1,119 pages assembled by the 16th–century sculptor Pompeo Leoni. Milan’s Biblioteca Ambrosiana and <a href="https://thevisualagency.com/about/">The Visual Agency</a> have created an <a href="https://codex-atlanticus.it/">interactive graphic</a> that lets you explore the pages by year and subject; you can also download that metadata through the graphic’s “About the project” section.
