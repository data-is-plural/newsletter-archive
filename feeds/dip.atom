<p><strong>Wildfires around the world.</strong> The <a
href="https://gwis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">Global Wildfire Information
System</a>, expanding on the work of <a
href="https://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">European Forest Fire Information
System</a>, uses satellite data to provide <a
href="https://gwis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/apps/gwis.statistics/">weekly and
annual estimates</a> of the number of fires and area burned in 200+
countries. Its <a
href="https://gwis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/apps/country.profile/downloads">bulk
data</a> indicates monthly burned hectares by country, sub-country unit,
and land type from 2002 to 2019, as well as the boundaries of individual
fires from 2001 to 2020. It also publishes <a
href="https://gwis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/applications/data-and-services">gridded
spatial data</a> relating to fire danger forecasts, active fires,
emissions, and more. <strong>As seen in</strong>: <a

<p><strong>Hospital price lists.</strong> Since January 2021, the US
government <a href="https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency">has
required hospitals to publish</a> machine-readable files listing the
standard charges for all items and services they provide. But there’s no
standard format for these price lists (also known as “chargemasters”),
no official central repository of them, and <a
href="https://www.patientrightsadvocate.org/semi-annual-compliance-report-2022">compliance
has been lacking</a>. Seeing those problems, the versioned-data platform
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a> earlier this year ran a
<a
href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-04-22-hospital-price-transparency-retrospective/">paid
crowdsourcing campaign</a> that pulled <a
href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-07-01-hospitals-compliance/">nearly
300 million prices from the published lists of roughly 1,800
hospitals</a> into a <a

<p><strong>New voting laws.</strong> The <a

2,000+ laws proposed in US state legislatures</a> since 2021. The
tracker focuses on “12 major issue areas relating to voter access and
representation,” such as early voting, same-day registration, and ID
requirements. It lists each bill’s state, number, author, date
introduced, current status, and issue areas, plus a summary and the
lab’s “assessment of whether the legislation is likely to improve or
interfere with voter access or the administration of elections.”

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Heat metrics.</strong> When you talk about outdoor heat,
you’re likely referring to “dry-bulb” temperatures, measured by a
thermometer shielded from the sun and moisture. But other factors also
contribute to the physiological experience of hot weather. To that end,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01405-3">Keith R.
Spangler et al.</a> have created a <a

heat metrics</a> for every county in the contiguous United States from
2000 through 2020. That first metric, for instance, was “originally
developed in the 1950s to establish epidemiologically relevant thermal
thresholds to prevent heat-related illnesses at US military training
camps,” and takes humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed into
account.</p>

<p><strong>State abortion laws.</strong> The <a

“research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and
reproductive health and rights,” maintains a <a
href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/overview-abortion-laws">table
summarizing each US state’s abortion laws</a>. It examines key aspects
of the legal landscape — such as gestational age limits, mandated
counseling, and whether an abortion must be performed by a licensed
physician — and links to topic-specific tables with <a

<p><strong>Incarceration and redistricting.</strong> The US Census
counts prisoners as residing where they are incarcerated. In 2010,
however, <a
href="https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/NYS_A9710-D.html">New York
passed a law</a> requiring the state to adjust these figures for
redistricting purposes, reassigning people in state and federal prisons
to their pre-incarceration addresses. Those adjusted counts, down to the
Census block level, are available for <a

fired, or a bullet hits school property for any reason, regardless of
the number of victims, time, day of the week.” It <a

from 1970 to the present and links them to information regarding 3,000+
victims killed and wounded, 2,200+ shooters, and 2,000+ weapons.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Supercomputers.</strong> Since 1993, a <a
href="https://www.top500.org/project/authors/">team of researchers</a>
has regularly assessed the most powerful computers in the world. The
resulting <a href="https://www.top500.org/">TOP500 lists</a> are
published twice a year, in June and November, using a <a
href="https://www.top500.org/project/linpack/">performance benchmark
developed by team member Jack Dongarra</a>, who <a
href="https://www.acm.org/media-center/2022/march/turing-award-2021">became
a Turing Award laureate this year</a>. Downloadable versions indicate
each supercomputer’s name, rank, location, manufacturer, year built,
power consumption, technical specifications, and more. <strong>As seen
in</strong>: “<a
href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/the-race-to-build-the-fastest-supercomputer/">The
race to build the fastest supercomputer</a>,” by Datawrapper’s <a

and is housed in a former chapel.</p>

<p><strong>Infrastructure permitting.</strong> The US government’s <a

Permitting Dashboard</a> tracks the “environmental review and
authorization processes for large or complex infrastructure projects,”
<a href="https://www.permits.performance.gov/about">particularly</a>
those funded by the Department of Transportation and those participating
in a <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/sustainability/fast-41-coordination">voluntary
review-coordination effort known as FAST-41</a>. The dashboard’s <a
href="https://data.permits.performance.gov/Permitting-Project/Permitting-Dashboard-Full-Dataset/mcm3-xbid">full
dataset</a> describes 12,000+ milestones relating to nearly 1,000
projects, roughly half of which have been completed. Online, you can <a

published, month/year read, page count, and whether it was <a
