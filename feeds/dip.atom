<p><em>Emissions, the Arab Barometer, Duterte’s drug war deaths, think tank citations, and jump scares.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Emissions indicators.</strong> The <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org">Climate Action Tracker</a> is “an independent scientific analysis” that keeps tabs on 32 countries’ progress on tackling climate change. Through its <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/data-portal/">data portal</a>, you can explore the project’s dozens of indicators — such as emissions per capita and renewable energy capacity — and also download the data in bulk. The countries covered include “the biggest emitters and a representative sample of smaller emitters,” and account for “about 80% of global emissions and approximately 70% of global population.” [h/t <a href="https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData">Erik Gahner Larsen</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>MENA public opinion.</strong> <a href="https://www.arabbarometer.org/about/">The Arab Barometer</a> has “been conducting high quality and reliable public opinion surveys in the Middle East and North Africa since 2006,” and bills itself as “the largest repository of publicly available data on the views of men and women in the MENA region.” You can <a href="https://www.arabbarometer.org/survey-data/data-downloads/">download raw survey data</a> or explore it through the Barometer’s <a href="https://www.arabbarometer.org/survey-data/data-analysis-tool/">online analysis tool</a>. [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisMarsicano/status/1201970565029879808">Chris Marsicano</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Duterte’s drug war deaths.</strong> In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Drug_War">the Philippines’ drug war</a>, President Rodrigo Duterte has given police broad permission to kill suspected drug dealers. But an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/08/philippines-dead-rodrigo-duterte-drug-war/595978/">investigation by reporters at the Columbia Journalism School</a> earlier this year found that “large numbers of killings [...] have been excluded from official counts.” The reporters collected data from <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6133399-Data-Sources-June04.html">23 sources</a> on 2,320 killings by police and unidentified assailants between July 2016 and December 2017 in three municipalities. <a href="https://data.world/stabile-center/ph-drug-war">Their dataset</a> (free account required to download, <a href="https://github.com/HRDAG/PH-drug-related-killings/tree/master/import/input">alternate version here</a>) indicates the month, local police station, whether police recorded the death, and more. <strong>Related</strong>: Because so many deaths appear to have gone unreported, the journalists worked with the <a href="https://hrdag.org/">Human Rights Data Analysis Group</a> to <a href="https://github.com/HRDAG/PH-drug-related-killings">estimate</a> the total number of undocumented deaths. [h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/shirafu">Scilla Alecci</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Think tank citations.</strong> <a href="http://andrewsthompson.co/">Andrew Thompson</a> scoured three years of articles from nine publications — Axios, BuzzFeed News, The Economist, The Hill, The New York Times, Politico, Vice News, Vox, and The Wall Street Journal — for mentions of any organization in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_think_tanks_in_the_United_States">Wikipedia’s list of US think tanks</a>. The <a href="https://components.one/datasets/think-tank-mentions-in-nine-publications-2016-2018/">resulting spreadsheet</a> contains more than 15,000 entries, relating to 172 think tanks. Each entry lists the publication, the think tank, the relevant sentence, and a link to the article.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Boo!</strong> <a href="https://wheresthejump.com/">Where’s The Jump</a> aims “to provide a comprehensive listing of the jump scares in horror and thriller movies.” The website doesn’t provide data downloads, but <a href="https://wheresthejump.com/full-movie-list/">its list of 540+ movies</a> — with year of release, “jump count,” “jump scare rating,” availability on Netflix, and more — can be copy-pasted into a spreadsheet. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://wheresthejump.com/the-lazy-directors-guide-to-jump-scares/">The Lazy Director’s Guide To Jump Scares</a>.” [h/t <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/FairWarning/issues/fair-warning-the-100th-edition-213612">Sophie Warnes</a>]</p>

<p><em>Death row, environmental treaties, spelling fixes, book ratings, and yearbook photos.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Death row.</strong> “Forty-three years after the Supreme Court reversed course and reinstated the death penalty, reliable data on the individuals sent to death row is maddeningly difficult to obtain.” <a href="https://theintercept.com/series/the-condemned/">So reporters at The Intercept</a> “set out to compile a comprehensive dataset on everyone sentenced to die in active death penalty jurisdictions since 1976.” <a href="https://github.com/firstlookmedia/the-condemned-data">The resulting database</a> contains more than 7,300 entries; for each person, it contains demographics, sentencing information, whether the person is still on death row, whether they’ve been exonerated, and more. <strong>Previously:</strong> <a href="https://endofitsrope.com/using-the-database/">Death sentences</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2018-08-01-edition">DIP 2018.08.01</a>), <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions/execution-database">executions</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2019-05-15-edition">DIP 2019.05.15</a>), and <a href="https://selectstarsql.com/frontmatter.html#dataset">last words</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2019-03-06-edition">DIP 2019.03.06</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Environmental treaties.</strong> The <a href="https://iea.uoregon.edu/">International Environmental Agreements Database Project</a> describes <a href="https://iea.uoregon.edu/iea-project-contents">more than 3,700</a> “international environmental treaties, conventions, and other agreements with links to text, membership, performance data, secretariat, and summary statistics.” The database, hosted at the University of Oregon, includes agreements from the 1850s to the present and can be <a href="https://iea.uoregon.edu/base-agreement-list">queried online</a>. It also includes detailed pages for each treaty, such as <a href="https://iea.uoregon.edu/membership-long-form/5046">this one for the UN’s Paris Agreement</a>. [h/t <a href="https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData">Erik Gahner Larsen</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Spelling fixes.</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/mhagiwara/github-typo-corpus">GitHub Typo Corpus</a> contains structured data on misspellings, bad grammar, and the ways they've been corrected. To build the dataset, <a href="http://masatohagiwara.net/">Masato Hagiwara</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/masatomita/">Masato Mita</a> analyzed the “commits” — sets of changes to files, typically accompanied by short summaries — made to tens of thousands of projects on the code-sharing platform GitHub. With “more than 350k edits and 65M characters in more than 15 languages,” <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12893">the authors say</a> it's “the largest dataset of misspellings to date.” [h/t <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/e5hdxt/spelling_and_grammar_correction_corpus_from/">u/Loves_Portisheads</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Book ratings.</strong> In 2004, computer scientist <a href="http://dbis.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/team/ziegler/cai">Cai-Nicolas Ziegler</a> scraped (with permission) <a href="http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/">433,000 numeric ratings of 186,000 books by 78,000 users</a> on the book-tracking website <a href="https://www.bookcrossing.com/">BookCrossing</a>. For most users, the data includes their stated city and age. [h/t <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02321">Ningshan Zhang, Kyle Schmaus, and Patrick O. Perry</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Yearbook photos.</strong> Over at The Pudding, <a href="https://www.elle-obrien.com/">Elle O'Brien</a> and <a href="http://jandiehmdesigns.com/">Jan Diehm</a> <a href="https://pudding.cool/2019/11/big-hair/">chart the rise and fall of “big hair”</a>. To ’do it, they <a href="https://github.com/andronovhopf/Bigdata_Bighair">combed through</a> a <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~shiry/projects/yearbooks/yearbooks.html">public dataset of 37,921 portraits</a>, culled from the yearbooks of 115 American high schools in 26 states between 1905 and 2013.

<p><em>Income inequality, ambassadorial qualifications, Samoa’s measles outbreak, science PhD candidates, and the Database of British and Irish Hills.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Income inequality around the world, over time.</strong> Political scientist <a href="https://fsolt.org/">Frederick Solt</a>’s <a href="https://fsolt.org/swiid/">Standardized World Income Inequality Database</a> provides annual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini coefficients</a> for 196 countries and territories. For many, the calculations go back to the 1960s. The database draws on <a href="https://fsolt.org/swiid/swiid_source/">hundreds of sources</a>, including international organizations, national statistical offices, and academic studies. In an <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mwnje/">accompanying paper</a>, Solt argues that the SWIID represents an improvement over other similar efforts, such as the United Nations University’s <a href="https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/wiid-world-income-inequality-database">World Income Inequality Database</a> (<a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-06-01-edition">DIP 2016.06.01</a>).

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ambassadorial qualifications.</strong> The Foreign Service Act of 1980 requires US presidents to provide Congress a “report on the demonstrated competence” for each ambassadorial nominee. In 2014, the government began <a href="https://www.state.gov/resources-bureau-of-human-resources/">disclosing these records</a>, which had long been held secret. But the government’s policy applied only to new nominees. Law professor <a href="https://ryanscoville.com/about/">Ryan Scoville</a>, however, used the Freedom of Information Act to pry loose the rest — more than three decades of concise biographies — and, earlier this year, <a href="https://ryanscoville.com/2019/02/13/certificates-of-competency-for-nominees-to-be-chiefs-of-mission-1980-2014/">put them online</a>, accompanied by a dataset that describes the nominees’ qualifications and political contributions. <strong>Related</strong>: “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3333988">Unqualified Ambassadors</a>,” Scoville’s <em>Duke Law Journal</em> article on the topic, and <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/troubling-trends-ambassadorial-appointments-1980-present">his summary in <em>Lawfare</em></a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Samoa’s measles outbreak.</strong> The Samoan government has been <a href="https://twitter.com/samoagovt/status/1201637336515112960">tweeting updates</a> regarding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Samoa_measles_outbreak">the country’s measles crisis</a>. Epidemiologist <a href="https://bitsandbugs.io/chris-von-csefalvay/">Chris von Csefalvay</a> has been <a href="https://github.com/chrisvoncsefalvay/samoa-measles-2019">converting those tweets into a simple dataset</a> that counts the number of cases and deaths (by age group) at the time of each tweet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Science PhD candidates.</strong> Last month, <em>Nature</em> released <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03459-7">findings</a> and <a href="https://figshare.com/s/74a5ea79d76ad66a8af8">response data</a> from its fifth survey of science graduate students. The questionnaire covered demographics, motivations, ambitions, satisfaction, mental health, and other topics. More than 6,000 students participated, including 1,000+ each living in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. <strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03489-1"><em>Nature</em>’s editorial board calls for “urgent attention” to students’ mental health</a>.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>UN blue helmets.</strong> The United Nations <a href="https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/open-data-portal">publishes data</a> describing its <a href="https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/peacekeeping-master-open-datasets">active peacekeeping missions</a> and <a href="https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/data-troop-and-police-contributions">police and military personnel</a>, plus <a href="https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/peacekeeper-fatalities">all peacekeeping fatalities since 1948</a>. <strong>Also:</strong> The International Peace Institute’s <a href="http://www.providingforpeacekeeping.org/contributions/">Peacekeeping Database</a> tracks member-countries’ historical contributions of personnel going back to 1990. <strong>Plus:</strong> Last month, researchers at Uppsala University’s Department of Peace and Conflict Research <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022343319871978?journalCode=jpra">introduced</a> a <a href="https://www.pcr.uu.se/data/geo-pko/">Geocoded Peacekeeping Operations dataset</a>, which provides detailed information about the location and troops for all UN peacekeeping deployments in Africa from 1994 to 2014, with stated plans to extend coverage through 2018 soon. [h/t <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IRstudies/comments/dmhn38/dataset_the_geocoded_peacekeeping_operations/">u/smurfyjenkins</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Earthquakes in Mexico.</strong> Researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0234-z">have constructed</a> a “unified catalog” more than 5,000 earthquakes in Mexico. To do so, they standardized, deduplicated, and fact-checked quake information from more than 100 local, regional, and international sources. <a href="https://springernature.figshare.com/collections/An_updated_and_unified_earthquake_catalog_1787-2018_for_seismic_hazard_assessment_studies_in_Mexico/4492763">The final dataset</a> goes back to 1787 and details each quake’s epicenter, depth, magnitude, and sources. The researchers consider the catalog to be complete for earthquakes with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale">moment magnitude</a> of 6+ since 1925, and for those with a magnitude of 4+ since 1990.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Seized Greek real estate.</strong> <a href="https://medium.com/athenslivegr/whose-home-is-this-f3b45d878b0b">For an article in AthensLive</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sotsideris">Sotiris Sideris</a> collected <a href="https://github.com/2109Sot/eauction_data">data on properties up for bidding</a> through <a href="https://www.eauction.gr/">eauction.gr</a>, Greece’s official website for auctioning real estate seized from over-indebted borrowers. The dataset includes 45,918 lots listed between mid-November 2017 (when the website launched) and September 1, 2019. For each lot, the dataset specifies the auction date, property characteristics, starting bid, total debt, debtor, “hastener” pursuing the auction, links to additional documentation, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Bollywood.</strong> <a href="https://pncnmnp.github.io/">Parth Parikh</a>, an engineering student in Mumbai, has created <a href="https://github.com/pncnmnp/TIMDB/">The Indian Movie Database</a>, which aggregates and cross-references data on Bollywood films from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a>, Wikipedia, and <a href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/">MovieLens</a>. It currently contains more than 4,700 movies released between 1950 and 2019.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Chicago prosecutions.</strong> Since early 2018, the <a href="https://www.cookcountystatesattorney.org/">Cook County State's Attorney's Office</a> has been publishing <a href="https://www.cookcountystatesattorney.org/about/case-level-data">detailed data</a> on every felony case it has handled since 2010.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Electricity prices.</strong> OpenEI’s <a href="https://openei.org/wiki/Utility_Rate_Database">Utility Rate Database</a> contains nearly 50,000 expert-verified rates — current and historical — for residential, commercial, industrial, and street-lighting electricity from thousands of US utility companies. <strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://openei.org/wiki/Data">OpenEI’s other data offerings</a>.

<p><strong>Financial well-being.</strong> Since the mid-1980s, the US Census Bureau has periodically conducted its <a href="https://www.census.gov/sipp/">Survey of Income and Program Participation</a> and provided <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/data/datasets.html">anonymized, respondent-level data</a>. In addition to the titular topics, the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/about/sipp-content-information.html">extensive questionnaires</a> also ask about “family dynamics, educational attainment, housing expenditures, asset ownership, health insurance, disability, child care, and food security.” <strong>Related:</strong> My colleagues <a href="https://twitter.com/scottpham">Scott Pham</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/venessawwong">Venessa Wong</a> <a href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2019-11-sipp">used SIPP’s data on familial support</a> to “<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/venessawong/millennials-parents-stereotypes-boomers-data">finally end the myth of the lazy millennial</a>.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Soccer/football play-by-play.</strong> A group of academics has partnered with a soccer-data company <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0247-7">to publish</a> what they believe to be “the largest collection of soccer-logs ever released.” <a href="https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000">The dataset</a> describes every “event” on the field — each pass, shot, foul, tackle, penalty, and more — for the 2017/18 season of five European leagues, the 2018 World Cup, and the 2016 European championship.</p>

<p><strong>Central Park squirrels.</strong> Last October, the <a href="https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/">Squirrel Census</a> dispatched 300+ volunteers to record every squirrel they saw in Central Park. In June, the organizers published a multimedia report of their findings (<a href="https://squirrelcensus.bigcartel.com/product/central-park-squirrel-census-2019-report">at $75 each</a>). Now they’ve made the data — with each squirrel’s location, fur color, behavior, and more — <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw">available through New York City’s open data portal</a>. <strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/06/squirrel-census-results-population-central-park-nyc/592162/">CityLab has more details on the project and interviews its creator</a>.

<p><strong>Bird sounds.</strong> Machine learning scientist <a href="https://github.com/AgaMiko">Agnieszka Mikołajczyk</a> has been <a href="https://github.com/AgaMiko/Bird-recognition-review">gathering useful resources</a> for identifying birds by sound. The resources include about a dozen datasets of audio recordings, many of which are immediately downloadable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Designer data.</strong> Nearly 10,000 people took the American Institute of Graphic Arts’ “Design Census” earlier this year. The (non-scientific but detailed) <a href="https://designcensus.org/">results are out</a>, and the raw data are (prominently) available to download.
